# IGA-saveload
This is a C++ library to help you import and export IGA (IsoGeometric Analysis) files.

To use this library, add the 'include' directory to your include paths, and add all of the files in the 'src' directory to your project.

A simple test application is included; you can find it in test/main.cpp. The CMakeLists.txt included with this repository will build that test application. It demonstrates how to read and write IGA data, and can be used to verify whether a particular IGA file is valid.
